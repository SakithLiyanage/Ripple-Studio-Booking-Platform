## üö® Root Cause

**The webhook URL is set to localhost:**

```
http://localhost:5000/api/webhooks/payhere
```

PayHere servers **cannot** reach localhost URLs. When a customer makes a payment, PayHere tries to send a webhook notification to your server, but it fails because `localhost` is only accessible from your computer, not from PayHere's servers.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: Use ngrok

ngrok creates a secure tunnel from a public URL to your localhost server, allowing PayHere to reach your webhook endpoint.

### Quick Fix (5 minutes):

#### Step 1: Install ngrok

```bash
npm install -g ngrok
```

#### Step 2: Start ngrok (keep this running)

```bash
ngrok http 5000
```

You'll see output like:

```
Session Status                online
Forwarding                    https://abc123-456.ngrok-free.app -> http://localhost:5000
```

#### Step 3: Copy the HTTPS URL

Copy the forwarding URL (e.g., `https://abc123-456.ngrok-free.app`)

#### Step 4: Update your .env file

```env
SERVER_URL=https://abc123-456.ngrok-free.app
```

#### Step 5: Update PayHere Dashboard

1. Login to [PayHere Merchant Dashboard](https://www.payhere.lk/merchant)
2. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Domains & Credentials**
3. Find **API Configuration** section
4. Set **Notify URL**: `https://abc123-456.ngrok-free.app/api/webhooks/payhere`
5. Click **Save**

#### Step 6: Restart Your Server

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

## üéØ Verification

After setup, you should see in your server logs:

```
============================================================
üöÄ Server running on port 5000
============================================================
üìä Health check: http://localhost:5000/health
üåç Environment: development

üîî PayHere Webhook Configuration:
   Webhook URL: https://abc123-456.ngrok-free.app/api/webhooks/payhere
   Test URL:    https://abc123-456.ngrok-free.app/api/webhooks/test
   Merchant ID: 1232121
   Mode: sandbox

‚úÖ Using public URL: https://abc123-456.ngrok-free.app
   PayHere webhooks should work correctly
```

## üß™ Test Payment Flow

1. **Start your server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start ngrok in another terminal:**

   ```bash
   ngrok http 5000
   ```

3. **Make a test booking** on your frontend

4. **Use PayHere test card:**
   - Card: 5123 4567 8901 2346
   - CVV: 123
   - Expiry: 12/25

5. **Watch server logs** for these messages:

   ```
   üì® PayHere webhook received
   ‚úì Webhook signature verified
   üéØ Handling payment success
   Processing wallet credit for studio owner
   Crediting wallet - Gross: 5000, Commission: 355, Net: 4645
   ‚úì Wallet credited successfully
   ```

6. **Check wallet dashboard** - Balance should increase by (payment - 7.1%)

## üîÑ Important Notes

1. **Keep ngrok running** - If you stop ngrok, webhooks will stop working
2. **URL changes** - Free ngrok URLs change every time you restart. Update .env and PayHere when this happens
3. **Paid ngrok** - Get a static URL with ngrok paid plan ($8/month)
4. **Production** - Use a real domain (not ngrok) for production deployments

## ‚ùì Common Questions

### Q: Why can't PayHere reach localhost?

**A:** Localhost is only accessible from your computer. PayHere servers are on the internet and need a public URL to send webhooks to.

### Q: Do I need ngrok for production?

**A:** No. Use a proper domain name (e.g., yourapp.com) when deploying to a real server.

### Q: My ngrok URL keeps changing. What should I do?

**A:** Free ngrok URLs change on restart. Either:

- Get a paid ngrok plan for a static URL
- Update .env and PayHere each time
- Deploy to a real server with a domain name

### Q: Is ngrok safe?

**A:** Yes, ngrok is widely used for development. It creates a secure tunnel and is trusted by developers worldwide.

### Q: Can I use something other than ngrok?

**A:** Yes! Alternatives include:

- localtunnel (free)
- serveo (free)
- localhost.run (free)
- cloudflare tunnel (free)
